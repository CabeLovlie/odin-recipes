    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Garlic sauce</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Place garlic in a mortar; season with salt and pound to a 
            very fine paste. (Alternatively, place garlic on a cutting 
            board, season with salt, and mash with the side of a chef's knife.) 
            Transfer garlic paste to a small bowl and gradually whisk in oil.
        </li>
        <li>
            Very gradually whisk yogurt into garlic mixture until emulsified. 
            (Add too fast and sauce will break. If it does break, gradually 
            whisk in 1 tsp. water just before serving.)
        </li>
        <li>
            DO AHEAD: Garlic sauce can be made 6 hours ahead. Cover and chill.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Chicken</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Toss chicken, garlic, parsley, cumin, paprika, and red pepper 
            flakes in a medium bowl; season with salt. Cover and chill at 
            least 2 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
            Prepare grill for medium-high heat and oil grate. Thread chicken 
            onto skewers. Grill, turning occasionally, until cooked through, 
            8-12 minutes. Serve with garlic sauce, pita bread, labneh, tomatoes, 
            and mint.
        </li>
        <li>
            DO AHEAD: Chicken can be marinated 12 hours ahead. Keep chilled.
        </li>
    </ol>
